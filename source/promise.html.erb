				<h3>Why Us?</h3>
				<p>
					For many, long-term care is a necessity that must be considered. Various circumstances force our hand in this matter. But when you find the right place to care for yourself or your loved ones, your perspective on this time in your life may change. Things become a lot easier.
				</p>

				<p>
					At The Carnelian, we don't treat you as just another client or another patient. Our community is one of strength, care, and commitment. We take our job seriously, and do so with a smile. To us, you're more than just a client: you're part of our family.

				<h3>
					Handmade Food
				</h3>
				<p>
					Few pleasures in life draw greater attention than food. It is a necessity for all, and a passion for many. So why do so many places get it so wrong?
				</p>

				<p>
					We are lovers of food, and we enjoy sharing that passion with you. All of our dishes are prepared with fresh ingredients, and never use frozen or processed
