					<h3>Making your everyday extraordinary.</h3>
					<p>At The Carnelian, our goal is to make you feel at home. Our commitment to you is to not only provide you with the best care possible, but also to make you feel like family.</p>

					<h3>Why Us?</h3>
				<p>
					For many people, long-term care is a necessity that must be considered. Various circumstances force our hand in this matter. But when you find the right place to care for yourself or your loved ones, your perspective on this time in your life may change. Things become a lot easier.
				</p>

				<p>
					At The Carnelian, we don't treat you as just another resident. Our community is one of strength, care, and building relationships. We take our commitment to you seriously, and greet the day with a smile. To us, you're more than just a client: you're part of our family.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are just a few of the things that make The Carnelian special:

					<h3>
						Community-Focused
					</h3>
					<p>Can't say specific numbers.</p>
					<p>With room for 30 residents in our home, we are large enough to maintain an interesting, vibrant community, yet small enough to cater to your individual needs.</p>
					<p>Our home is decorated with comfort, style, and gatherings in mind. You can enjoy lounging in the family room, strolling through the rose garden, or chatting with friends in one of the gazebos outside.</p>

					<h3>
							Homemade Food
						</h3>
						<p>
							Few pleasures in life draw greater attention than food. It is a necessity for all, and a passion for many. So why do so many places get it so wrong?
						</p>

						<p>
							We are lovers of food, and we enjoy sharing that passion with you. All of our dishes are prepared with fresh ingredients; never frozen or processed. You'll fall in love with the taste, variety, and nutrition of our meals. Did we mention dessert?

					<h3>
							Events &amp; Activties
						</h3>
						<p>We believe that no matter your limitation or situation, being active is a great way to remain happy and healthy. That's why we take each of our residents for daily walks through our luscious rose garden, feature musical guests five times a week, and even offer formal exercise classes. And for those who are more mellow-minded, we have movie nights, bingo, and arts and crafts. And we go all out for our holiday parti

					<h3>
							Professional Care
						</h3>
						<p>
							You wouldn't be reading this if you didn't need professional assistance caring for yourself or a loved one.
						</p>
						<p>What separates CArnelian from bigger places is that we spend the time wit the residents. A personal touch. Don't rush the residents. One caregiver has five residents to care for. </p>

						<p>
							The Carnelian employs professional caregivers with many years of experience. We strive to provide excellent care with a personal, familial touch that you won't find anywhere else.
